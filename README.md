An Empirical Study on Fake News Analysis: Leveraging Machine Learning Models for Detection and Classification


## Summary

In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of fake news through the application of a Logistic Regression-based machine learning model. Leveraging the model, we achieved an impressive 97% training accuracy, demonstrating its proficiency in learning from labeled data. Furthermore, our model exhibited a robust performance in real-world scenarios, achieving a high detection accuracy of 98%. This project contributes to the ongoing efforts in enhancing media literacy and combating the spread of misinformation through the utilization of advanced machine learning techniques.
